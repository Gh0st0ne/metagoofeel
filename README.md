# Metagoofeel

Web crawler and downloader based on GNU Wget.

The goal is to be less intrusive than simply mirroring an entire website.

You can also import your own list with already crawled URLs (e.g. from Burp Suite).

Current regular expression for extracting URLs from GNU Wget's output is `"(?<=URL\:\ )[^\s]+?(?=\ 200\ OK)"` and for downloading is simply to check if the supplied keyword is contained in a URL.

Tweak this tool to your liking by modifying regular expressions.

Tested on Kali Linux v2020.3 (64-bit).

Made for educational purposes. I hope it will help!
